# Keras RetinaNet 

Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)
by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

Check [this page](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) for original Keras implementation.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) In the repository, execute `pip install . --user`.
   Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed,
   this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch Linux results in an incorrect installation).
   Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements.
   Also, make sure Keras 2.1.3 or higher is installed.
3) Optionally, install `pycocotools` if you want to train / test on the MS COCO dataset by running `pip install --user git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI`.
